    "### 1. Anaconda\n",
    "- An all-inclusive resort for running software: jupyter notebook, python, and others.\n",
    "- Software runs inside their own local environment, preventing conflicts with the environment of your physical machine.\n",
    "- Default local environment is \"base\", but one can create new environments per project/pipeline.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> *An environment is a virtual computer with (in our case) its own Python installation, python libraries/packages, and specific library/package versions, which can be completely different from what is installed on the physical machine or other environments.*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">> **When linked to a python pipeline**\n",
    ">> - Guarantees successful runs across time.\n",
    ">>   - Runs under the same conditions in which it was ***successfully*** built.\n",
    ">>   - Prevents breaks caused by updates to python packages in the future. \n",
    ">> - Guarantees successful runs across separate physical machines.\n",
    ">>   - Gives the user the software recipe to build the correct environment, instead of using their machine's native environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "####\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "- This is a Windows command-line terminal that is already initialized to interact directly with Anaconda environments.\n",
    "- In this terminal you can:\n",
    "> - `conda activate <path-to-environment-folder>` — Activate existing Anaconda environments.\n",
    "> - `conda deactivate` — Deactivate current environment.\n",
    "> - `pip install <python-package-name>` — Install a python package into the *activated* environment\n",
    "> - `pip install -e .` — Install the python pipeline into the *activated* environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "####\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Included in the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "- Useful when you want to run python interactively: explore the data, generate plots, run and test python scripts as one builds them. \n",
    "- To run a python script non-interactively, one exports the notebook as an **Executable Script**. This creates a python/**.py** file used to either:\n",
    "> - store python functions that collectively build a package — packages allow you to easily call functions inside other python scripts.\n",
    "> - executes the pipeline: reads data, processes data into results, outputs results.\n",
    ">> ***Note:*** *jupyter notebooks are ***not*** used to run the pipeline or build the pipeline's associated python package.*\n",
    "- Has ability to run under any python environment (or \"kernel\") created within Anaconda — i.e. can emulate the true pipeline environment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "####\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visual Studio Code\n",
    "- A text editor with python syntax highlighting via an external application called *Pylance*.\n",
    "- It can run python code but I use it to easily edit python scripts (.py), rather than run code. \n",
    "> **Check that Pylance is installed**\n",
    "> - Open up VSC\n",
    "> - Go to file > New File -> Dropdown menu\n",
    "> - Check in the dropdown menu for the \"Python File\" option.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> **Download Pylance**\n",
    ">> - Open up VSC\n",
    ">> - Select the 5th icon down in the left pane\n",

    ">> - Click on Pylance and install it. \n",

    "- **Github** is a cloud service that stores repositories of code, allowing for simultaneous collaboration. \n",
    "> ***It's Box but for code, not data!***\n",
    "- Cloud repositories are downloaded, or ***cloned***, onto your physical machine. \n",
    "> - make changes locally\n",

    "### 6. Git\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git** is version control softare through which your local repository and the cloud repository communicate.\n",
    "- It comes with a suite of commands that give users ***some*** control over that relationship.\n",
    "- The emphasis is on **CONTROL**. \n",
    "> - It errs on the side of making sure you don't do something you didn't intend. So,\n",
    "> - User control can become very complex when there are several collaborators making changes daily and simultaneously.     \n",
    ">> **For or our purposes, we will be avoiding that complexity and only need to learn a small number of commands, simple version-control concepts, and basic best practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Git commands run locally in Git Bash**\n",
    "> - `git init` — initialize local folder for github\n",
    "> - `git clone <repository url>` — copy a repo in the cloud to your local computer\n",
    "> - `git checkout -b <name>` — create a \"branch\" on which to make changes to the repo.\n",
    "> - `git status` — what is different between your local repo and the cloud repo\n",
    "> - `git commit -m \"<description>\"` — package all the local changes under a single purpose, preparing them to be pushed to the cloud  \n",
    "> - `git add <file>` or `git add .` — add an untracked file or all untracked files (\".\") to be an official member of the repo.\n",
    "> - `git rm <file>` — remove a file from being tracked by the repo \n",
    "> - `git push -u origin main` or `git push -u origin <branch>` — push the local changes to the repo or to a branch off the repo.  \n",

    "### 7. Git Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git Bash** is a command-line terminal for Windows that lets you run Git commands and, as a bonus, many Linux-style system commands inside a Bash shell.\n",
    "- Python was built for Unix/Linux systems.\n",
    "- Most servers run Linux with Bash, so nearly all software and data engineers are fluent in Bash—much more than Windows command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Linux-Bash system commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `cd <path/to/folder>` — navigate to a folder  \n",
    "> - `mkdir <name>` — create a folder  \n",
    "> - `ls` — list files in the current directory  \n",
    "> - `cp <file> <path>` — copy a file to a new location  \n",
    "> - `rm <file>` — delete a file  \n",
    "> - `touch <file.ext>` — create an empty file with the given extension\n",
